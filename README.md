In actuatulity, I first grabbed the OBB file for the game. (Should be in Android/obb/com.sega.tokyo/Offline). Then moved it to my PC and extracted it using 7Zip. Then did some Unity fuckey magic to extract the actual models.

### "Can use these for my super cool thing I'm using on?"
~~ABSOLUTELY NOT HOW DARE YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT DOING THAT ABSOLUTE SIN~~
Yes! Go ahead. Do anything with these models. (Well, maybe not everything. You know what I mean.)

### "Do I credit you if I use these rips?"
Nope! They're not my models after all. All I ask is if you make something cool with these models, be sure to send me it 

### "Github is weird to work with. Can I reupload them to the Models Resources (Or another similar site)?"
I was going to do that but I got too lazy. So, go ahead.

### "Have you seen the mayor of Otter Ferry?"
Sure! I passed him near the stone monument!

### "He is a traitor to his town. Will you lead us to him?"
A traitor? Then let's move before he gets away!
