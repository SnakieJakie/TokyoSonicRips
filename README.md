# Tokyo Sonic Rips
Models rips from Sonic At The Olympic Games. (The mobile game)

# What's here?

Some of the characters. Not all of them, though.

> [!CAUTION]
> Pretty much all of the characters' eyes are not UVmapped. I'm too stupid to do that myself. If you can fix it, and want me to put your fixed version in this repo, shoot me a DM or a pull request.

| Character | Notes | Download |

| Tails | He "has" a swim version, like Sonic and Amy, but it's exactly the same as the normal version, so I didn't include it. | [Download](https://github.com/SnakieJakie/TokyoSonicRips/raw/main/Zips/Models/Characters/TokyoTails.zip) |
| Amy | N/A | [Download](https://github.com/SnakieJakie/TokyoSonicRips/raw/main/Zips/Models/Characters/TokyoAmy.zip) |
| Rouge | N/A | [Download](https://github.com/SnakieJakie/TokyoSonicRips/raw/main/Zips/Models/Characters/TokyoRouge.zip) |
| Knuckles | N/A | [Download](https://github.com/SnakieJakie/TokyoSonicRips/raw/main/Zips/Models/Characters/TokyoKnuckles.zip) |
| Chao | For some reason, they have bowties on, even though they're not Cheese. The ZIP comes with a "quest" version which looks like a plushie. No clue where it's used in-game. | [Download](https://github.com/SnakieJakie/TokyoSonicRips/raw/main/Zips/Models/Characters/TokyoChao.zip) |

# Q/A

### "This repo doesn't have the model I'm looking for. What gives?"
I'll add more models when I can. 

### "What's the difference between I and M models.
M models seem to be more blocky and less detailed than the I ones. 

### "How did you extract these models?"
I managed to hack into SEGA's network (it was called gay porn), and grabbed the models pls dont tell them tho

<details>
  <summary> </summary>
In actuatulity, I first grabbed the OBB file for the game. (Should be in Android/obb/com.sega.tokyo/Offline). Then moved it to my PC and extracted it using 7Zip. Then did some Unity fuckey magic to extract the actual models. I'm being vague because I don't want to teach people how to decompile Unity games :skull:
</details>

### "Can use these for my super cool thing I'm using on?"
~~ABSOLUTELY NOT HOW DARE YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT DOING THAT ABSOLUTE SIN~~
Yes! Go ahead. Do anything with these models. (Well, maybe not everything. You know what I mean.)

### "Do I credit you if I use these rips?"
Nope! They're not my models after all. All I ask is if you make something cool with these models, be sure to send it to me so I can look at it. (Well, not anything NSFW please.)

### "Github is weird to work with. Can I reupload them to the Models Resources (Or another similar site)?"
I was going to do that but I got too lazy. So, go ahead.

### "Have you seen the mayor of Otter Ferry?"
Sure! I passed him near the stone monument!

### "He is a traitor to his town. Will you lead us to him?"
A traitor? Then let's move before he gets away!
